// 1. Intro to Linked List - A LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, LinkedLists are not stored in contiguous memory locations.


// 2. Types of Linked Lists:

    // 2.1 Singly Linked List - Each node points to the next node.

    // 2.2 Doubly Linked List - Each node points to both the next and the previous node.

    // 2.3 Circular Linked List - The last node points back to the first node.
